This repository holds all the code about my thesis.

Folder structure:
- Preliminary analysis: analysis of the considered datasets, the correlations between the columns and the consistency of the available data
- Pattern extraction: extracting transactions for the associative classification and analysis of the most common patterns for several different parameters of interest
- Associative classification: application of the association rules and performance assessment in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and f1 score
- Other classifiers: application of other classifiers for comparison with the associative classification results
