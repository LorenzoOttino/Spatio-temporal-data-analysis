This folder contains the code about the preliminary analysis.
Each notebook contains the analysis of the data available in the corresponding dataset (available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share).

The "correlation" files contain an insight of the correlation of the number of bikes available in each station.

"Bike_variations" contains an analysis of the consistency of the data about trips and stations' status - more precisely, an equivalent of the "status" file is generated with the information coming from the trips, and their difference is analysed.
